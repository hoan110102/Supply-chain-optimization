# Introduction
With the increase in demand for purchasing today, the issue of supply chain optimization is becoming very important for many retail businesses. Solving supply chain problems to increase profits, provide goods to customers on time, etc. is a problem that requires a lot of time and effort. As an analyst at a company specializing in selling sports products, I need to analyze past data to find insights to help the company optimize the supply chain. In this project, I will focus on analyzing 3 main aspects including demand, supplier and delivery.
